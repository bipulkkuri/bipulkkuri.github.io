1. AWS Migration Approach:  
   - Describe a project where you migrated on-premises workloads to AWS. What were the challenges, and how did you handle them?
   - How would you approach migrating scheduled jobs from a legacy scheduler (like JAMS) to AWS services?
======
Get the job details id,name,env,execution sequence,condition or events, schedules from JAMS 
identify Any fallback recovery steps 

Test and deploy in lower env validate
Migration strategy 


2. AWS Lambda and Step Functions:
   - Explain how AWS Lambda works and its limitations for scheduled jobs.
   - How would you use AWS Step Functions to manage a sequence of tasks that previously ran in JAMS?
   - Describe a scenario where Step Functions would be preferable over Lambda alone for a job workflow.

=== 
AWS lamda 15min per execution timeout 3sec,payload 6mb ,memm 3GB,package size 50mb, 10k/sec increment of 1k
AWS Step Functions  choice ,parallel ,map ,pass(trasnform),wait,sucess,fail ,visual view easy to understand,retry policy
when multiple dependent steps are needed with above states which lamda cannot do 



3. AWS Glue:
   - What is AWS Glue, and how would you use it in this project to manage and migrate ETL processes?
   - Explain how you would set up an ETL job in Glue for data migration from JAMS to AWS RDS.
===
AWS glue serverless ETL ,data cataloging from s3 ,glue studio visual no code data quality ,data brew(transformations)

4. AWS RDS:
   - Describe how you would migrate data stored in JAMS-managed databases to AWS RDS.
   - How would you ensure data integrity and security during a migration to RDS?
===
DMS (schema conversion if needed)Bulk Load + AWS Data sync for CDC 
make sure data at rest + transit is encrypted with strong IAM access policy 
do data cleansing remove duplicates if busines logic allows 
before migration take backups , do data mapping if schemas are changing and if any transformations are needed 

Technical Skills in Scripting and Automation
5. PowerShell Scripting for AWS:
   - Describe how you would use PowerShell to interact with AWS services. What AWS-specific PowerShell modules or commands have you used?
   - Provide an example of how youâ€™ve automated a process in PowerShell that involved AWS resources.
===
AWS tools for powershell ,uses keys from IAM,access key secret key region ,in powershell use the before to connect


6. Python for AWS Automation:
   - How would you use Python to manage AWS resources programmatically?
   - Describe a Python script you wrote to handle job scheduling or data transformation in AWS.
==
use boto3 library , created emr_client to start stop jobs

7. Error Handling and Logging:
   - How do you handle error handling and logging for scheduled jobs in AWS?
   - Describe how you would implement logging and monitoring in AWS for jobs previously managed by JAMS.

===
logging in code , audit log 
aws schedular cloudwatch /DLQ


Project Planning and Documentation
8. Project Documentation:
   - How would you document the migration process to ensure a smooth transition?
   - Describe your experience with documentation in previous projects, especially for migration or consolidation tasks.
===
Plan timeline ,teams , teams data mapping testing,rollback ,communication actors , risk mitigation staratgies
keep versioned documentation
Phased approcach with incremental goals with agreed upon priority



9. Testing and Validation of Migrated Jobs:
   - What strategies do you use to validate the functionality of jobs after migration?
   - How would you ensure that each job performs as expected in the AWS environment?

===
Functional output should be same with time ,data quality,test cases execution with test bed data


10. End-of-Year (EOY) Deadline Management:
    - With the EOY deadline approaching, what would your strategy be for managing the migration of 50-70 jobs?
    - How would you prioritize jobs for migration, and what factors would influence your timeline?
===
Identify top priorty jobs that need to be migrated wcich needs to be done before EOY
bucket similar or smaller jobs which dont have dependency to be completed and do work in parallel while other jobs are getting implemnted
build a plan and estimate for dependent jobs and follow order
